## about Polyrhythmia

Polyrhythmia is a challenging 2-button rhythm game that explores polyrhythms, concentrating on cross-rhythms in particular. These polyrhythms are represented as Euclidean Rhythms in game, presented visiually as nodes rotating around a circular path. <br>

Polyrhythmia was created for the Github Gamejam 2022, this game explores the theme of "scale" <br>

- the tempo scales the speed of the levels and therefor the difficulty of the game <br>
- the music is all for a harp sampler instrument tuned to a particular just-intonation scale in the key of G <br>
- the long beats are scaled into subdivisions <br>
- the levels are scaled-up into a massive wheel-of-wheels that represent the greater subdivision of the music into beats and measures, presenting the music on a larger scale <br>

## Gameplay <br>
Match your button presses with the markers rotating around the wheels when they meet in the center. <br>
